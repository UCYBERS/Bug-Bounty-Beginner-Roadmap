# Bug Bounty Beginner's Roadmap

Hello! I'm **DARK**. I work as a Network and Information Security Engineer and Ethical Hacker. I've created this repository for everyone to contribute to, aiming to guide young and enthusiastic individuals in starting their careers in bug bounty. More content will be added regularly, so keep following along. Let's get started!

***NOTE:*** The bug bounty landscape has evolved significantly over the past few years. Issues that were easy to find a year ago are now much more challenging. Automation is widely used, and most of the "low-hanging fruit" are often duplicated if you're unlucky. If you want to start in bug bounty, you need to be determined, consistent, and focused, as the competition is very intense.

# Introduction

- **What is a bug?**
  - A security bug or vulnerability is a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, negatively impacts confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

- **What is Bug Bounty?**
  - A bug bounty, or bug bounty program, is IT jargon for a reward program offered for finding and reporting bugs in a particular software product. Many IT companies offer bug bounties to drive product improvement and increase interaction from end users or clients. Companies with bug bounty programs may receive hundreds of bug reports, including security bugs and vulnerabilities, with many reporters standing to receive awards.

- **What is the Reward?**
  - Rewards vary based on the severity of the issue and the cost to fix it. They can range from real money (most common) to premium subscriptions (e.g., Prime, Netflix), discount coupons (for e-commerce or shopping sites), gift vouchers, and swags (apparel, badges, customized stationery, etc.). Monetary rewards can range from $50 to $50,000 or even more.

# Bug Bounty Platforms

 - **Crowdsourcing**
	 - Bugcrowd: https://www.bugcrowd.com/
	 - Hackerone: https://www.hackerone.com/
	 - Intigriti: https://www.intigriti.com/
	 - YesWeHack: https://www.yeswehack.com/

	 - Google: https://about.google/appsecurity/

# Bug Bounty Report Format

 - **Title**
	 - The first impression is the last impression, the security engineer
   looks at the title first and he should be able to identify the issue.
   - Write about what kind of functionality you can able to abuse or what kind
   of protection you can bypass. Write in just one line.
   - Include the Impact of the issue in the title if possible.

 - **Description**
	 - This component provides details of the vulnerability, you can explain the vulnerability here, write about the paths, endpoints, error messages you got while testing. You can also attach HTTP requests, vulnerable source code.

 - **Steps to Reproduce**
	 - Write the stepwise process to recreate the bug. It is important for an app owner to be able to verify what you've found and understand the scenario.
	 - You must write each step clearly in-order to demonstrate the issue. that helps security engineers to triage fast.

 - **Proof of Concept**
	 - This component is the visual of the whole work. You can record a demonstration video or attach screenshots.

 - **Impact**
	 - Write about the real-life impact, How an attacker can take advantage if he/she successfully exploits the vulnerability. 
	 - What type of possible damages could be done? (avoid writing about the theoretical impact)
	 - Should align with the business objective of the organization

### Some additional Tips
1. **Don't do bug bounty as a full time** in the beginning (although I suggest don't do it full time at any point). There is no guarantee to get bugs every other day, there is no stability. Always keep multiple sources of income (bug bounty not being the primary).
2. **Stay updated**, learning should never stop. Join twitter, follow good people, maintain the curiosity to learn something new every day. Read writeups, blogs and keep expanding your knowledge.
3. Always see **bug bounty as a medium to enhance your skills**. Money will come only after you have the skills. Take money as a motivation only.
4. **Don't be dependent on automation**. You can't expect a tool to generate money for you. Automation is everywhere. The key to success in Bug Bounty is to be unique. Build your own methodology, learn from others and apply on your own. 
5. Always try to escalate the severity of the bug, **Keep a broader mindset**. An RCE always has higher impact than arbitrary file upload.
6. It's not necessary that a vulnerability will be rewarded based on the industry defined standard impact. The asset owners **rate the issue with a risk rating**, often calculated as *impact * likelyhood* (exploitability). For example, an SQL Injection by default has a Critical impact, but if the application is accessible only inside the organization VPN and doesn't contain any user data/PII in the database, the likelyhood of the exploitation is reduced, so does the risk.
6. **Stay connected to the community**. Learn and contribute. There is always someone better than you in something. don't miss an opportunity to network. Join forums, go to conferences and hacking events, meet people, learn from their experiences. 
7. **Always be helpful**.
